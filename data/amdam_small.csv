The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.",,"The neighbourhood is well served by 24 hours public transport (2 trams and 4 buses).

Thank you for visiting my listing. I love my home and am happy to welcome guests.

I am a 47 year old mom and I live here with my partner Jan.  My 20 year old son studies outside Amsterdam and stays with us during the weekends. I  work in private health care, specialized with dementia. I started out as a home exchanger, so I know how great it feels to have a home away form home when you visit a big city. After a long day full of walking and sight seeing it is wonderful to get home and lay on a sofa or take a bath and get a fresh soda from your own fridge without a mini bar bill!

Welcome to my Airbnb profile!

I have a great apartment in Amsterdam,  it offers an ideal place if you plan a short trip to this great town, but also offers enough privacy and luxury if you choose a longer get away.

Having traveled much for work and in private, I think I know what can make you feel at home in a different city or culture. Amsterdam always makes me feel at home and I hope it will just be the same for you! 

I will always check you in myself and will be at your full disposal during your stay in Amsterdam. Should you need advice, assistance or help of any kind just feel free to ask me. So if you want to book concert tickets for a gig or upcoming event, if you want to be put on a guest list or need seats in a top notch restaurant or perhaps need tickets to a match of AJAX AMSTERDAM, don't hesitate to contact me because I will do my best to get you sorted. 

I am open to last minute requests or long term stays and am always willing to look at the best price to match your needs. Flexible check in and check outs upon request. 

Feel free to ask me anything about your possible stay.

I enjoy food, it doesn't really matter what it is, the nicest food to me would be Sri- Lankan dishes, the curry leaves there give dishes such a special flavour. Whisky is the newest drink I have discovered for myself, Irish or Scotch, it doesn't really matter I am co founder of the Amsterdam Whisky Club.
Walking and cycling are a great past time for me too, my partner and I especially love exploring the city and country side.

The first 10 years I spent in Amsterdam, I lived in many neighbourhoods. After having stayed in the Jordaan I knew that was the right place for me to call home. It has a lively village feel and the romantic and spacious canals create a feeling of freedom. Soon afterwards, now 13 years ago, I was lucky to find my home, the apartment that is available for you.

I like others to enjoy my lovely apartment when I am away. It is too pretty to sit empty and so well situated to experience Amsterdam. Right in the middle of all that Amsterdam has to offer!

I am from Amsterdam and work as an brand manager. I joined Airbnb in 2011 when I traveled a lot for work and enjoyed the idea that my space was being used by like-minded travelers. I know my city very well and usually prepare a personal list of favourites to advice my guests on where to go depending on their interests. My interests include interior design, cooking, Japanese ceramics, sports and music.

When traveling for leisure I enjoy going through Airbnb to find a local neighbourhood and enjoy the city as a local, I am a very respectful guest to your place and your neighbours.

We are three young individuals who started a B&B together.
Rose, loves to read books, might be the reason why she studies Literature. 
Anjo, finished his bachelor in Psycology, lives in Leuven Belgium.
Mirre, is an Art and theatre fanatic, studied theatre and at the moment she studies fine art and design.
Together we love to take care of people and making sure they have a wonderful stay. We know al the ins and outs about our city, where to go for the best art from the golden age to the newest bars in town. Where to go to for your perfect Amsterdam biking experience and where the secret swimming spots are for the summer. From the best dutch apple pie to the famous chinese oysters of Nam Kee.

Red light district is a one of a kind neighborhood, there is never a dull moment. But if you want to look beyond the tourist point of few ask us for the alternative guide to the red light district, with design shops bars game halls great coffee and cakes.


We hope you will love our city as much as we do.
